## Part 1: Roles & Responsibilities (as Senior SRE + Principal Cloud Architect)

### 🎯 Core Responsibilities

#### AI-Ready SaaS Infrastructure
- Architect **multi-cloud platforms (AWS / GCP / Azure)** tailored for AI/ML workloads (training, inference, pipelines).  
- Ensure GPU/accelerator integration (AWS SageMaker, EKS GPU nodes, FSx for Lustre, EFS for datasets).  
- Build **multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure** with isolation, scaling, and **usage-based metering** for cost efficiency.  

#### SRE for AI Services
- Define **SLOs & SLIs** for AI inference workloads (latency, accuracy drift, throughput).  
- Build **self-healing + auto-scaling clusters** (horizontal scaling for inference, batch orchestration for training).  
- Enforce **error budget policies**: allow innovation in Sandbox, protect SLAs in Production.  

#### DevSecOps for AI/ML
- Create **CI/CD pipelines** for:  
  - Data pipelines  
  - Model training workflows  
  - Inference endpoint deployments  
- Embed **security guardrails**:  
  - Data encryption (KMS, TLS in transit).  
  - Model version integrity & approvals.  
  - API security (WAF + API Gateway + IAM).  
- Ensure **compliance** with GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 for sensitive financial & PII data.  

#### Leadership & Team
- **Mentor & lead** SREs, MLOps engineers, and Cloud engineers.  
- Foster **blameless postmortems** & a culture of reliability.  
- Balance **innovation vs reliability** → allow experimentation while protecting production SLAs.  
- Act as the **bridge between Data Scientists & Engineers** → ensure models are deployed reliably, at scale.

## 🎯 Planning

### What We Are Building
A **real-time fraud detection platform** that leverages AWS services for:
- Training fraud detection models on historical data.  
- Registering models with governance controls.  
- Deploying via CI/CD pipelines with **Guardrails**.  
- Serving predictions through a public API with **ms-level latency**.  
- Ensuring **compliance, cost-efficiency, and resilience**.  

### What We Aim to Achieve
- Reduce fraud losses by flagging high-risk transactions.  
- Improve customer trust with accurate real-time decisions.  
- Scale to multi-tenant SaaS environments with isolation.  
- Optimize cost via **Spot training, serverless inference, and FinOps quotas**.

## 🛠️ Strategy

1. **Multi-tenant ready**: Isolated Studio domains, per-tenant S3 buckets.  
2. **Governed datasets**: Amazon DataZone integration.  
3. **CI/CD integration**: CodePipeline + CodeBuild + CodeDeploy.  
4. **Guardrails**: Latency/error budget monitoring, rollback, retraining.  
5. **Cost Optimization**: Spot training, serverless inference, multi-model endpoints.  
6. **Security Compliance**: OPA/Conftest in CodeBuild, WAF on API Gateway.

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

- **Fraud API** uses **API Gateway + Lambda + SageMaker Endpoint**.  
- **Redis Caching (ElastiCache)** integrated into Fraud Lambda for sub-ms lookups.  
- **Suspicious Transactions** stored in DynamoDB for analyst review.  
- **Logs** pushed to S3 with **Glacier lifecycle policies** (30 → 90 days → 7 years).  
- **Rollback Lambda** with CloudWatch alarms + 30-day log retention.  
- **FinOps Guardrails**: AWS Budgets + Anomaly Detection alerts.  
- **CI/CD** includes **Test Stage** (unit + integration tests) before Sandbox deployment.  
- **QuickSight dashboards** provide business analytics (manual setup required).

## 📊 Workflow Views

### Customer View
Customer → Payment App → Fraud API → Response (LEGIT / REVIEW / SUSPICIOUS)

### Technical View
EFS → S3 (data) → SageMaker Training → Model Registry → CI/CD → Sandbox → Canary → Prod → API Gateway + Lambda → DynamoDB/S3/Redis → Monitoring

### Business View
Fraud Detection → Fraud Loss Reduction → Compliance Adherence → Customer Trust → Cost Optimization (Spot + Serverless + Glacier)

## 🗂️ Storage Mapping

| Service        | Purpose                        | Latency/Cost Profile |
|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| **EFS**        | Studio notebooks, scripts      | ms, shared, persistent |
| **S3**         | Training/test data, logs       | ms, durable, cheap |
| **DynamoDB**   | Suspicious txn store           | ms, scalable |
| **ElastiCache**| Fraud score cache              | µs, in-memory |
| **Glacier**    | Archived logs (7 yrs)          | hrs, cheapest |
| **CloudWatch** | Logs/metrics/alerts            | ms, pay-per-metric |
